A React renderer for Notion pages.
Use Notion as CMS for your blog, documentation or personal site.

**`react-notion` was developed by <a href="http://splitbee.io/">Splitbee</a>. Splitbee is a fast, reliable, free, and modern analytics for any team.**

_This package doesn't handle the communication with the API. Check out [notion-api-worker](https://github.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker) for an easy solution_.

‚ö°Ô∏è **Fast** ‚Äì Up to 10x faster than Notion\*

üéØ **Accurate** ‚Äì Results are _almost_ identical

üîÆ **Code Highlighting** ‚Äì Automatic code highlighting with [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/)

_\* First Meaningful Paint compared to a [hosted example](http://react-notion-example.now.sh/) on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)._


**react-notion** is best suited as minimal renderer for blogs & content pages. If you're looking for a full-featured solution to render Notion-like pages, check out [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x).


## Install

```bash
npm install react-notion
```

## How to use

### Minimal Example

We can store the API response in a `.json` file and import it.

```js
import "react-notion/src/styles.css";
import "prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css"; // only needed for code highlighting
import { NotionRenderer } from "react-notion";

import response from "./load-page-chunk-response.json"; // https://www.notion.so/api/v3/loadPageChunk

const blockMap = response.recordMap.block;

export default () => (
  <div style={{ maxWidth: 768 }}>
    <NotionRenderer blockMap={blockMap} />
  </div>
);
```

A working example can be found inside the `example` directory.

### Next.js Example

In this example we use [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for SSG. We use [notion-api-worker](https://github.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker) to fetch data from the API.

`/pages/my-post.jsx`

```js
import "react-notion/src/styles.css";
import "prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css";

import { NotionRenderer } from "react-notion";

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetch(
    "https://notion-api.splitbee.io/v1/page/<NOTION_PAGE_ID>"
  ).then(res => res.json());

  return {
    props: {
      blockMap: data
    }
  };
}

export default ({ blockMap }) => (
  <div style={{ maxWidth: 768 }}>
    <NotionRenderer blockMap={blockMap} />
  </div>
);
```

## Block Type Specific Caveats

When using a code block in your Notion page, `NotionRenderer` will use `prismjs` to detect the language of the code block.
By default in most project, `prismjs` won't include all language packages in the minified build of your project.
This tends to be an issue for those using `react-notion` in a `next.js` project.
To ensure the programming language is correctly highlighted in production builds, one should explicitly imported into the project.

```jsx
import 'prismjs/components/prism-{language}';
```
